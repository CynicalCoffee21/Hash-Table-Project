# Hash-Table-Project
This is a project that I did for school to demonstrate my creation and use of a 
Hash Table using seperate chaining. The hashing used is just the generic hash method generated
by eclipse.

The project contains JUnit test classes, a Black Box testing document, and relevant javadoc. 
There is a simple command line UI, and the project is written in Java using OO concepts 
and the mvc design pattern.
